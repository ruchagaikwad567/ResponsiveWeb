        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag">The need for a more expansive and high-quality education system in India is well-known. Accordingly, the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry has embarked on an ambitious programme of education reform. However by the ministrys own internal estimate, the gross allocation to education in the Eleventh Plan (2007-12) covers only 20 percent of the total investment required. This strengthens the case for greater private sector participation. Given that consumer spend on education is expected to grow eight-fold over the next two decades, the size of opportunity for private players in education is substantial.Currently, the private sector plays three roles in Indian education. Firstly it plays a direct role in the formal education sector comprising K-12 schools and higher education institutions (colleges and universities). In K-12 education, most private schools, except for those affiliated with offshore examination boards, are bound by a ‘not-for-profit diktat. There is relatively greater freedom in higher education though operational control on fees, curriculum, student intake etc are stringent.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag">Given the tremendous growth in the number of U.S. students studying abroad over the last two decades, the study abroad industry has become more crowded and competitive in recent years. The study abroad business has traditionally been a cottage industry with a hodgepodge of domestic and foreign universities, for-profit and non-profit independent organizations providing thousands of programs in more than 100 countries. Some, like the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, offer their own programs, with their own courses and curricular expectations. Others, like the Institute for the International Education of Students (IES) and The College of Global Studies at Arcadia University, offer some of their own programs, but also are known for acting as intermediaries—offering student services, plus a quality control stamp, for those students enrolling in foreign universities who want more of a cushion than what's available when they directly enroll through international student offices abroad.According to the Institute of International Education, the majority of U.S. college students studying abroad, about 72 percent, participate on programs sponsored by their home institution. However, at least 28 percent of the approximately 260,000 Americans who studied abroad in academic year 2008/09 study through an outside program.</p>
